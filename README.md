About _xdot.py_
=================

_xdot.py_ is an interactive viewer for graphs written in [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)'s [dot language](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html).

It uses internally the GraphViz's [xdot output format](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/output.html#d:xdot) as an intermediate format, [Python GTK bindings](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io), and [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/) for rendering.

_xdot.py_ can be used either as a standalone application from command line, or as a library embedded in your Python application.

Status
======

_xdot.py_ script became much more popular than I ever anticipated, and there are several interested in improving it further.  However, for several years now, _xdot.py_ already meets my own needs, and unfortunately I don't have much time for maintaining it myself.

So I'm looking into transition _xdot.py_ maintenance to [others](https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py/wiki/Forks): either hand over the maintenance _xdot.py_ to a community or indicate an official fork of _xdot.py_.

I encourage people interested in development of _xdot.py_ to fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py), and join the new [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/xdot-py).

Features
========

 * Since it doesn't use bitmaps it is fast and has a small memory footprint.
 * Arbitrary zoom.
 * Keyboard/mouse navigation.
 * Supports events on the nodes with URLs.
 * Animated jumping between nodes.
 * Highlights node/edge under mouse.

Known Issues
============

 * Not all xdot attributes are supported or correctly rendered yet. It works well for my applications but YMMV.

 * Text doesn't scale properly to large sizes if font hinting is enabled. I haven't found a reliable way to disable font hinting during rendering yet.

Windows users
-------------

Download and install:

 * [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

 * [PyGObject bindings for GTK3](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/PyGObject)

 * [Graphviz for Windows](http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php)

Debian/Ubuntu users
-------------------

Run:

    apt-get install gir1.2-gtk-3.0 python3-gi python3-gi-cairo graphviz

Usage
=====

Command Line
------------

If you install _xdot.py_ from PyPI or from your Linux distribution package managing system, you should have the `xdot` somewhere in your `PATH` automatically.

When running _xdot.py_ from its source tree, you can run it by first setting `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to the full path of _xdot.py_'s source tree, then running:

    python3 -m xdot

You can also pass the following options:

    Usage:
    	xdot.py [file|-]
    
    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FILTER, --filter=FILTER
                            graphviz filter: dot, neato, twopi, circo, or fdp
                            [default: dot]
      -n, --no-filter       assume input is already filtered into xdot format (use
                            e.g. dot -Txdot)
      -g GEOMETRY           default window size in form WxH
    
    Shortcuts:
      Up, Down, Left, Right     scroll
      PageUp, +, =              zoom in
      PageDown, -               zoom out
      R                         reload dot file
      F                         find
      Q                         quit
      P                         print
      T                         toggle toolbar
      Escape                    halt animation
      Ctrl-drag                 zoom in/out
      Shift-drag                zooms an area

If `-` is given as input file then _xdot.py_ will read the dot graph from the standard input.

Embedding
---------

See included `sample.py` script for an example of how to embedded _xdot.py_ into another application.
